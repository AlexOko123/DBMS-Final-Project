He is known for his television work, specifically as creator, head writer, executive producer, and director of Breaking Bad and its spin-off Better Call Saul. He was a writer and producer for The X-Files and was the co-creator of its spin-off The Lone Gunmen.Both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul have received widespread critical acclaim, with Gilligan winning two Primetime Emmy Awards, six Writers Guild of America Awards, two Critics\' Choice Television Awards and Producers Guild of America Awards, one Directors Guild of America Award and a BAFTA. Outside of television, he co-wrote the screenplay for the 2008 film Hancock.Gilligan was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Gail, a grade school teacher, and George Vincent Gilligan Sr., an insurance claims adjuster. His parents divorced in 1974 and he and his younger brother, Patrick, were raised in Farmville and Chesterfield County, and attended the laboratory school run by Longwood College. Growing up, Gilligan became best friends with future film editor and film title designer Angus Wall. His interest in film began when Wall\'s mother, Jackie, who also taught alongside Gilligan\'s mother, would lend her Super 8 film cameras to him. He used the camera to make science fiction films with Patrick. One of his first films was entitled Space Wreck, starring his brother in the lead role. One year later, he won first prize for his age group in a film competition at the University of Virginia.Jackie would take Wall and Gilligan to Richmond and drop them off at Cloverleaf Mall to see films, and encourage both of them to pursue a career in the arts. "I wouldn\'t be where I am today if it wasn\'t for Jackie. She was a wonderful lady and a real inspiration," he recalls. Gilligan was recognized for his talents and creativity at an early age. George Sr. described him as a "kind of a studious-type young man, and he liked to read, and he had a vivid imagination". He introduced Gilligan to film noir classics, as well as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood Westerns on late-night television. Gilligan won a scholarship to attend the prestigious Interlochen Center for the Arts. After eighth grade, he moved back to Chesterfield to attend high school.After graduating from Lloyd C. Bird High School in 1985, Gilligan went on to attend NYU\'s Tisch School of the Arts on a scholarship, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film production. While at NYU, he wrote the screenplay for Home Fries; Gilligan received the Virginia Governor\'s Screenwriting Award in 1989 for the screenplay, which was later turned into a film.

('nm0153740', 'David', None, 'Chase', 'Born in Mt. Vernon, New York, and raised in New Jersey, David Chase\n(born David DeCesare) dreamed of being a star drummer in a rock\nband! He spent many years playing drums and bass trying to be part of a\nsuccessful rock band in the 1960s East Coast music scene. He also loved\nmovies, such as The Public Enemy (1931) with James Cagney and TV shows like The Untouchables (1959) with\nRobert Stack. When not making music, he watched 1960s\' Hollywood and foreign\nfilms avidly. After his music career ended, he got the inspiration to\nbuy a movie camera and make his own movies. He studied at the Tisch\nSchool of the Arts at New York University and later the graduate film\nprogram at Stanford University. He began writing for network TV drama\nprograms in the early 1970s. He eventually became a writer and producer\non the classic NBC detective show The Rockford Files (1974) with James Garner. While on\n"Rockford", he penned many memorable episodes and pieces of dialog. He\nwon his first Emmy in 1978, the year "Rockford" won the award for Best\nDramatic Series. Many biographies incorrectly state that Chase won his\nfirst Emmy for writing the acclaimed TV movie, Off the Minnesota Strip (1980). Although it is\na sensitive and well observed story about a young runaway trying to\nmake sense of her life after being returned to her Midwestern family\nfrom a life of prostitution in New York City, Chase actually won his\nsecond Emmy (and a Writer\'s Guild Award) for that project. He then\nspent the 1980s and early 1990s getting paid for writing various TV\nscripts while writing feature film projects that never got produced. He\nalso began directing his TV scripts whenever possible. He often told\npeople stories about the troubled relationship he shared back in New\nJersey with his mother. Encouraged to write about it, he found a way to\ncombine a story about his mother with a mob story and a story about\npsychotherapy, which Chase had also began during this time. This\nintersection of ideas and themes led Chase to write the landmark pilot\nscript to a show that the Fox network developed, then passed on\nshooting. HBO then decided to roll the dice with Chase on this odd\nmixture of mother/son conflict, mobster danger and insecurities about\npsychological therapy. The result: The Sopranos (1999). Everybody connected with\nthe project thought they would film a pilot episode, it would not go to\nseries and that would be that. It has since gone on to become one of\nthe most successful shows to ever come out of a cable network. Chase\nand his crew have collected Emmy, Golden Globe, Writer\'s Guild and\nDirector\'s Guild Awards for the show. In terms of impact and subject\nmatter, it has been compared to The Godfather (1972). Chase vows to get his feature\nfilm projects off the ground, as soon as "The Sopranos" ends its\nrun.', datetime.datetime(1945, 8, 22, 0, 0), 79)

His father was born in Ontario, Canada, of French-Canadian\ndescent, and his mother was English. He was educated at Ashmead\nComprehensive School and went on to study at University College,\nLondon, where he gained a degree in Philosophy.After university, Gervais attempted to pursue a pop career with Seona\nDancing, a duo he formed with a fellow student. Similar to many groups\nin the early 1980s, they were a synth-pop act with a somewhat\npretentious name and exhibiting a strong musical influence by\nDavid Bowie. Gervais adopted a\nvocal style that has often been compared to Bowie; comedian\nPaul Merton would later joke\nthat Bowie nicked their music. Seona Dancing were briefly signed to a\nrecording contract and released two singles, "More to Lose" and "Bitter\nHeart". The latter was slightly reminiscent of\nQueen\'s "Body Language" from a year\nearlier, featuring a similar synthesizer riff. The act failed to breach\nthe UK top 75 and earn a place in the Guinness Book of British Hit\nSingles, but clips have survived and they have been frequently used to\ntease Gervais in interviews. Despite his own lack of success, Gervais\nstayed within the music industry for a while and even spent time as the\nmanager of Suede.Gervais had to wait a long time before achieving the fame he had hoped\nwould come with a pop career. In the 1990s he formed a writing\npartnership with Stephen Merchant. In\n2000, he landed his own comedy chat show on Channel 4,\nMeet Ricky Gervais (2000),\nwhich attracted legendary guests such as\nJimmy Savile,\nMichael Winner,\nPaul Daniels,\nPeter Purves,\nStefanie Powers,\nJim Bowen and\nMidge Ure. The series only ran for six\nepisodes but a year later greater stardom came for Gervais with the\ndebut of BBC comedy\nThe Office (2001). Although it was\nnot initially received to great acclaim or viewing figures, it is now\noften cited as one of the greatest comedy series of all time and has\nbeen credited with reinventing the sitcom. Gervais starred as the\nobnoxious and embarrassing office manager David Brent, who has since\nbeen voted in various polls one of the greatest comic characters. It\nalso prompted an American remake,\nThe Office (2005). Gervais had\nfurther success with another sitcom,\nExtras (2005), which attracted a\nseries of celebrity guests, including\nBen Stiller,\nSamuel L. Jackson and his musical idol\nDavid Bowie. It served as a\nsatire on the entertainment industry and leading stars were happy to\nplay along by performing exaggerated versions of themselves.Gervais has become one of the most popular and omnipresent comedy\nperformers of the 21st century, hosting the Golden Globe awards,\nlending his talent to films, becoming a voice artist and appearing on\nnumerous talk shows.

His father has French-Canadian, German, and Italian ancestry, and his mother was from a Russian Jewish family. He attended the Bronx High School of Science before furthering his studies at Queens College in 1984. Dropping out just credits away from receiving his degree, Jon moved to Chicago where he focused on comedy and performed at several Chicago improvisational theaters, including the ImprovOlympic and the Improv Institute. He also found a couple of bit parts in films.While there, he earned another bit role in the film, Rudy (1993), and met fellow cast mate Vince Vaughn. Their enduring personal friendship would play an instrumental role in furthering both their professional careers within just a few years. Jon broke into TV with a role on the classic series, Seinfeld (1989) (as "Eric the Clown"). After filming rudimentary roles in the movies Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994), Notes from Underground (1995) and Batman Forever (1995), he decided to do some risk taking by writing himself and friend Vaughn into what would become their breakthrough film. Swingers (1996), which he also co-produced, centers on Jon as a luckless, struggling actor type who is emotionally shattered after losing his girlfriend, but is pushed back into the L.A. social scene via the help of cool, worldly, outgoing actor/buddy Vaughn. These two blueprint roles went on to define the character types of both actors on film.In 1997, Jon appeared favorably on several episodes of the popular TV sitcom, Friends (1994), as "Pete Becker", the humdrum but extremely wealthy suitor for Courteney Cox\'s "Monica" character, and also appeared to fine advantage on the Tracey Takes On... (1996) comedy series. He later took on the biopic mini-movie, Rocky Marciano (1999), portraying the prizefighter himself in a highly challenging dramatic role and received excellent reviews.

As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, "the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person".

The family eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister\'s tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire.

His father was of Polish descent, and his mother\'s ancestry is Irish and Italian. His mother was a mortgage consultant and his father became a teacher for blind veterans in a VA hospital outside of Chicago. When Galecki was sixteen, his father died in an accident.His mother recalled in an interview with People magazine that Galecki was a very artistic kid; at only 4 years old, he told her: "Mom, I\'m gonna be on T.V., and I don\'t mean when I grow up." Two years later, when their attempts to distract him with sports failed, Galecki\'s parents took him to open auditions at local theaters in Chicago. He landed his first role in "Fiddler on the Roof," and more parts in other productions followed. By age 11, he was already known as an excellent actor in Chicago\'s theater scene evidenced by him receiving a Joseph Jefferson Citation nomination for portraying John Henry in "The Member of the Wedding."In 1989 he was cast in his first movie, a holiday film called Prancer (1989), but his big break was in another Christmas movie as Chevy Chase\'s son Rusty Griswold, in National Lampoon\'s Christmas Vacation (1989). On the set, Chase took a liking to him, and Galecki recalled in a later interview that Chevy Chase showed him some tricks for comedic timing.By that time, his whole family had moved from Chicago to L.A. to support his career. But within 10 months they realized they missed Chicago too much, and moved back home. Galecki, still just 14, was under contract on a show with Robert Urich called "American Dreamer (1990)", so he stayed in L.A. Although he was living alone in a studio apartment, he never got into trouble and was a good kid. He recalled living alone in L.A. without adult supervision as "not fun" and "quite intimidating and lonely, to be honest. But I\'ve always been happiest when I\'m working, so..." He bought a motorcycle with a mirrored helmet so he could get to work and back, at Paramount studios.In 1991 Galecki was picked by Roseanne Barr to play her son in the made for T.V. movie Backfield in Motion (1991). She liked him so much she asked him to come on her sitcom for what started as a one-off appearance, but soon turned into the important recurring role of David Healy. His family was religious viewers of the show and he was somewhat intimidated at first to be working with his television heroes. However, before long, it was his heroes that praised him: Roseanne said he showed "great vulnerability." John Goodman said: "If he was one of those little stuffed bears at a carny, he\'d have a Wuv me t-shirt on. People just want to take care of him."

('tt0903747', 'FiRE010', 'Really Great', "I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it.", 10, datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 3, 0, 0))

And when I heard that there was a spin-off regarding Saul Goodman, I thought maybe the show could have some solid and funny moments, and maybe bring a bit of depth towards some beloved Breaking Bad characters.Spin-offs in television are usually seen to me as fan service, or a way to make more money off of a franchise that was loved. That doesn't mean that all of them are bad, but most of them don't have the passion or care that'd make you think it was extremely necessary to make a spin-off, especially considering the risk of making previous characters look bad writing wise. And while Better Call Saul was AMC's idea to make more money off of the franchise, I'm shocked with how the creators and writers were able to make another masterpiece.This show was always meant to be in the shadow of Breaking Bad in my eyes, and I never would've thought of these shows as something that'd be deserving to talk about in the same breath as one another. But Better Call Saul took the ball that Breaking Bad was rolling, picked it up, and launched it forward.While I think Breaking Bad has peaks that no other show can reach, Better Call Saul was able to do things that it's predecessor never could. The depth and writing of these characters are honestly perfect. So much so that I'd consider the shows leads Jimmy and Kim to be two of the best written characters in television history. And while the cast of this show is extremely stacked, Chuck McGill to me is a character that's honestly overlooked compared to the rest. His character has a pretty clear consensus amongst most people, but there's so much to him and Jimmy's dynamic that's it's honestly not as black and white as most people make it out to be, despite both being objectively wrong in certain aspects of the series. It's really fascinating to me.The main aspect of the show that baffles me is how perfectly timed the arcs are considering this is a prequel. Every event in the show is written so well and is paced in a brilliant way to the point where no character arc seems to be rushed, yet the show still remains interesting. You think you've reached the pinnacle of a characters journey, then a curveball is thrown that changes everything.That's not even mentioning how balanced both the lawyer side and the cartel side of the show are. When I first started the show I was eager to get more of the Mike and cartel portion, but the lawyer side of the story honestly paved the way for the first half of this show and was the most compelling part of the first 3 seasons.My word of advice to anyone who watches this show.1. Be patient\n2. Understand that th", 10, datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 7, 0, 0))
('tt0096697', 'amarkovic-65487', "I'm glad I'm not the only one...", "I was hesitant to give this the rating I did, but from reading other audience reviews, my review actually will come across as far more... lenient. What can I say that hasn't been said already, the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. Going through it again, it was awe inspiring to me how they manage to structure joke upon joke upon joke upon joke, something that must've been a complete breath of fresh air considering the boring, lifeless, milk-toast excuses for comedy shows that were coming around at that time. Yeah, those ones using canned laughter which relied completely on actors and people being loud as an excuse to be funny with a roaring laughter every 5 seconds spoon feeding the audience of when to laugh, with an exception of Seinfeld these were just boring shows for boring people, The Simpsons was intelligent, heart felt, structured and most of all... FUNNY.However, all good things must come to an end. In an ideal scenario, The Simpsons ended on season 10 and season 9 didn't include the infamous 'The Principal and The Pauper', it lives its legacy as one of the greatest TV shows of all time and is passed down from generation to generation. Sure, the season 9 and 10 weren't golden age material, they were still solid entries in The Simpsons canon but then from season 11, things started to drastically change, we were getting episodes which would've been some of the weaker episodes in a golden age era season that were the best episodes of the season they were actually in. Sure, season 13 was pretty good but the show was tanking in quality almost directly after, pretty much season 14 onwards was terrible (not to mention the really bland movie). Now we're on the 31st season, the show is just completely unwatchable, the best episodes are mediocre and boring and the worst episodes are... 'Lisa Goes Gaga' (if you know what I mean). The show, at this point, is almost completely unrecognisable, a mere slight resemblance of what it once was (even the animation sucks nowadays), that's why it's so damn difficult to rate this show, at the same time it's one of my favourite and least favourite shows, the show should've ended 20 years ago, you can't keep lightning in a bottle for that long, it's not a show that is relevant to today's cultural landscape, it would be so much more respected if it had ended on its 10th season. That's why I can't in good conscience rate this show the 9 or 10/10 that I want to... but the only reason I'm giving it a 7 over a 5 is because even though there is more bad than good of The Simpsons (more signals for it to just end), the golden age is some of the best television to have ever been constructed and cannot be ignored.Here's how I'd rate the seasons:\nSeason 1 - 8/10\nSeason 2 - 8/10\nSeason 3 - 9/10\nSeason 4 - 9/10\nSeason 5 - 10/10\nSeason 6 - 10/10 (best season)\nSeason 7 - 9/10\nSeason 8 - 8/10\nSeason 9 - 8/10\nSeason 10 - 7/10\nSeason 11 - 6/10\nSeason 12 - 6/10\nSeason 13 - 7/10\nSeason 14 - 5/10\nSeaso", 8, datetime.datetime(2020, 4, 12, 0, 0))

The second the show starts you can tell that the characters fit perfectly with each other, and involved with the craziness that happens in the universe with Rick and Morty, they are immediately hilarious and extremely creative at the same time. A couple episodes in and I could tell that this was a unique show, and that people need to be watching it because it has huge potential. And with Dan Harmon writing and directing at the helm of it all, the magic that this show brings is a rare gem in television that people need to watch.. So yeah I highly suggest this show to anyone who wants a true genuine laugh at least once a week.', 10, datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 21, 0, 0))

It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show.", 10, datetime.datetime(2006, 11, 6, 0, 0))

Whether you like this show or not there's no denying that it's obviously one of the most popular sitcoms of all-time, all you have to do is look at the ratings, how much the cast was paid and considering it's on all the time.
